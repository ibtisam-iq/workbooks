- **Hands-On Proof**: Commands and outputs directly from real-world practice sessions.  
- **Efficient Revision**: A quick reference without revisiting lengthy courses (30+ hours).  
- **Growth Journey**: Refined understanding through multiple iterations - Docker (3rd attempt), Kubernetes (2nd attempt).  

## What's Inside?

## Note  
This repository reflects my determination to transition from a non-tech background to IT. It’s not just about commands - it’s about commitment and growth.
