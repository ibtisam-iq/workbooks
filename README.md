# DevOps Workbooks Repository

## About

This repository contains **real console commands and outputs** from my hands-on practice with Docker, Kubernetes, and other DevOps tools. It's a snapshot of my practical learning journey and serves as both a personal reference and a showcase of my skills.

## Why This Repository?

- **Hands-On Proof**: Commands and outputs directly from real-world practice sessions.
- **Efficient Revision**: A quick reference without revisiting lengthy courses (30+ hours).
- **Growth Journey**: Refined understanding through multiple iterations - Docker (3rd attempt), Kubernetes (2nd attempt).

## What's Inside?

- `dockerWorkbook.txt`: Demonstrates practical Docker workflows and real-time outputs.
- `k8sWorkbook.txt`: Demonstrates practical Kubernetes workflows and real-time outputs.

## Note

This repository reflects my determination to transition from a non-tech background to IT. It’s not just about commands - it’s about commitment and growth.
